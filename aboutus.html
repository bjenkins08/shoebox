            <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>We are the Shoebox, founded in 2018 as a singular store in the heart of downtown Detroit, MI. Started by the two Jenkins brothers to in order to pay for college, little did they know it would be such a success, they would not need a college degree anymore, so the pair dropped out of college and pursued the business full time. The brothers gained enough money to open a second location in their home town, Martinsburg, WV. They opened this location here, even though the area was not highly populated, to give the kids in their home town what the wish they has growing up... a sneaker store. They continued to expand, and are now estimating $30 million in 2023.</p>

            <h4>Who we are</h4>
                <p>The Jenkins brothers... Braden and Greyson, are brothers who are originally from Martinsburg, WV but have lived in Detroit since they were 17 and 12. They grew up loving sneakers but having really nowhere to buy them from, leaving them to risk buying them online, knowing the risk of them either not fitting or being fake. Braden, the older brother by 5 years, learned that buying online was not the best option for buying shoes because he was scammed into buying fakes multiple times and he has ordered many shoes that, didn't fit true to their size. Braden wished there was a better way to buy sneakers locally. He struggled with fake/small shoes for years, rarely finding good places to buy shoes. When he moved to Detroit, MI in 2015 he realized he could buy his shoes from other people, who care about shoes equally as much as him, in actual stores so he could try them on and see if they were real before he bought them! He knew it was a great business opportunity and almost four years later, in December 2018, he bought up a small shop in Detroit right off of 2nd Ave to flip and turn into a sneaker shoe he called the Shoebox. He ran this for 3 more years on his own until he could hire his brother, and they could run it together. They have now expanded to 50 locations in 24 states worth over $25 million, their most succesful location to this day, is still the original Detroit location which is still run by Braden and Greyson.</p>
